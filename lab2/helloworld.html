			<h1>Hello World (Yooha Kim)</h1>
			<p>My name is Yooha Kim and I'm a 4th year ARTG major. Recently I've been working on a game project in a small team for my capstone course, and it has made me more interested in finding ways to express myself through mediums such as sound design and programming, which is one of the reasons why I chose this class!</p>
