				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The challenge for this lab is to explore some of the cross-internet interaction that is possible through jQuery and AJAX functionalities by making a simple GET request to an API of choice.</p>

				<h2>Problems</h2>
			</div>
			<p>The biggest problem I had was "finding" the JSON object that was returned by the endpoint. Implementing the AJAX request was relatively simple, but it was hard to tell if it was working. After a youtube search I discovered that Inspect Element featured a "Network" tab which listed all the network requests and file statuses, which is where I found the JSON object that the API had returned.</p>
