			<h1>Subject</h1>
			<p>
				The subject of the lab was to teach us that
				understanding the overall structure and hierarchy
				that our files live in is important, and that
				it is necessary to keep organized in order to be able
				to callback to and utilize this hierarchy later.
			</p>
			<h1>Challenges/Summary of Efforts</h1>
			<p>
				One difficulty that I ran into this lab was trying to
				align my image on the front page and having the background color for the main
				section to stretch over towards the background image.

				Changing the file structure, connecting the CSS files, and committing/pushing
				to GitHub worked smoothly.
