			<h1>Subject</h1>
			<p>
				The subject of the lab was to teach us that
				understanding the overall structure and hierarchy
				that our files live in is important, and that
				it is necessary to keep organized in order to be able
				to callback to and utilize this hierarchy later.
			</p>
			<h1>Challenges</h1>
			<p>
				I did not run into any difficulties completing this lab.
